Euler-CBFCM-GUI
===============

GUI for Euler CBFCM (Case Based Fuzzy Cognitive Maps) inference engine.

The GUI is based on EulerGUI, a generic GUI for Semantic Web and inference engines.

The CBFCM (Case Based Fuzzy Cognitive Maps) inference engine is based on [Euler / EYE](http://eulersharp.sourceforge.net/), an inference engine for the Notation 3 (N3) logic language,
by Jos De Roo.
